    "* Various debugging methods exist.   \n",
    "Relatively simple approaches include carefully examining error messages, adding print statements to the code to review intermediate results, and selectively commenting out code.   \n",
    "If these methods are not sufficient to identify and fix errors, a Python debugger can be used such as the PythonWin Debugger.   \n",
    "A debugger allows you to carefully step through the code line by line to review error messages and examine the state of variables.   \n",

    "* Any debugging procedure will typically identify where the error occurs but not exactly why it occurs.   \n",

    "* Basic error-handling procedures include checking whether data exists, determining w hether data inputs are the right type, check ing for licenses and extensions , and validating table and fieldnames.  \n",

    "These excep tions can be trapped using a try-except statement.   \n",
    "This type of statement makes it possible to identify the type of error or else specific errors.   \n",
    "Customized error-handling procedure can be impl me nt based on the nature of the error.   \n",
