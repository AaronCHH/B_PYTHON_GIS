## 4.3 Working with data types and structures

## 4.4 Working with numbers
```python
3 * 8
16 / 4
17 % 4
7 / 3
7 / 3.0
```

## 4.5 Working w ith variables and naming
* Style Guide for Python Code http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

```python
x = 17
x * 2
# ---
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
```

## 4.6 Writing statements and expressions
```python
x = 2 * 17
print x
```

## 4.7 Using strings
```python
print "I said: 'Let's go!'"
```
```python
x = "G"
y = "I"
z = "S"
print x + y + z
```
```python
x = "Geographic"
y = "Information"
z = "Systems"
print x + " " + y + " " + z
```
```python
# wrong
temp = 32
print "The temperature is " + temp + " degrees"
# correct
temp = 32
print "The temperature is " + str(temp) + " degrees"
```

## 4.8 Using lists
```
mylist = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16 , 32 , 64]
```
```
mywords = ["jpg", "bmp", "tif", "img"]
print mywords
```

## 4.9 Working with Python objects
```python
name = "Paul"
name
id(name)
type(name)
```
```python
var1 = 100
type(var1)
```
```python
var2 = 2.0
type(var2)
```

## 4.10 Using functions
```python
pow(2,3)
print dir(__builtins__)
print pow.__doc__
```

## 4.11 Using methods
```python
topic = "Geographic Information Systems"
topic.count("i")
```

## 4.12 Working with strings
```python
mytext = "GIS is cool"
print mytext.lower()
print mytext.upper()
print mytext.title()
```
```python
mystring = "Geographic Information Systems"
mystring[0]
mystring[23]
mystring[-1]
mystring[11:22]
mystring[11:]
mystring.find["Info"]
mystring.find["info"]
"Info" in mystring
```

* join

```python
list_gis = ["Geographic" , "Information", "Systems"]
string_gis = " "
string_gis.join(list_gis)
```

* split

```python
pythonstring = "Geoprocessing using Python scripts"
pythonlist = pythonstring.split(" ")
pythonlist
```

* strip, rstrip, lstrip

```
# allows you to remove any combination of characters in any order from the ends of an existing string
mytext = "Commenting scripts is good"
mytext.strip("Cdo")
mytext.rstrip("Cdo")
mytext.lstrip("Cdo")
```

* replace

```
mygis = "Geographic Information Systems"
mygis.replace("Systems", "Science")
```
```
myfile = "streams.shp"
myfile.replace(".shp", "")
```
```
temp = 100
print "The temperature is {0} degrees".format(temp)
```
```
username = "Paul"
password = "surf$&9*"
print "{0}'s password is {1}".format(username, password)
```

## 4.13 Working with lists
```
cities = ["Austin", "Baltimore", "Cleveland", "Denver", "Eugene"]
```
```
print len(cities)
```
```
cities.sort(reverse = True)
print cities
```
```
cities.sort
print cities
```
```
cities[1]
cities[-1]
cities[-2]
cities[2:4]
cities[2:]
cities[:2]
```
```
"Baltimore" in cities
"Seattle" in cities
```

* del

```
cities = ["Austin", "Baltimore", "Cleveland", "Denver", "Eugene"]
del cities[2]
cities
```

* append

```
cities = ["Austin", "Baltimore"]
cities.append("Cleveland")
cities
```

* count

```
yesno = ["True", "True", "False", "True", "False"]
yesno.count("True")
```

* extend

```
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [11, 12, 13, 14]
list1.extend(list2)
list1
```

* index

```
mylist = ["The", "quick", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
mylist.index("the")
```

* insert

```
cities = ["Austin", "Cleveland", "Denver", "Eugene"]
cities.insert(1, "Baltimore")
cities
```

* pop

```
cities = ["Austin", "Baltimore", "Cleveland", "Denver", "Eugene"]
cities.pop(3)
```

* remove

```
numbers = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
numbers.remove(0)
numbers
```

## 4.14 Working with paths
```
1. Use a forw slash (/) - for example,
"C:/EsriPress/Python/Data".

2. Use two backslashes (\\) - for example,
"C:\\EsriPress\\Python\\Data".

3. Use a string literal by placing the letter r before a string - for example,
r"C:\EsriPress\Python\Data".
The letter r stands for "raw string," which means that a backslash will not be read as an escape character
```

## 4.15 Working with modules
```
import math
math.cos(1)

print math.cos.__doc__
dir(math)

from math import cos
cos(1)

import itme
print dir(time)

time.time()

time.localtime()

time.asctime()

import keyword
print keyword.kwlist
```

## 4.16 Controlling workf1 ow using conditional statements
```python
import random
x = random.randint(0, 6)
print x
if x == 6:
	print "You win!"
```
```
== Eqaual to
!= Not equal to
```

## 4.17 Controlling workflow using loop structures
```python
import random
x = random.randint(0, 6)
print x
if x == 6:
	print "You win!"
elif x == 5:
	print "Try again!"
else:
	print "You lose!"
```

```python
# infinite loop
i = 0
while i <= 10:
	print i
```

```python
i = 12
while i <= 10:
	print i
	i += 1
```

```python
mylist = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
for letter in mylist:
	print letter
```

```python
import sys
x = int(sys.argv[1])
y = int(sys.argv[2])
print x * y
```

## 4.18 Getting user input

```{py id:"izmbxsk8"}
x = input("")
```

## 4.19 Commenting scripts

> Note: Using the number sign (#) is not the only way to indicate a line is a comment.

> Sometimes double number signs (##) are used instead, although this is often reserved for temporarily commenting out code temporarily turning code into comments so as not to lose it. The effect is the same: Code lines that start with number signs (# or ##) are not un

## 4.20 Working with code in the PythonWin editor


```python

```

## 4.21 Following coding guidelines


```python

```

## Points to remember

This chapter introduces you to the fundamentals of the Python language. There is obviously much more to learn about Python functionality, but these fundamentals will allow you to get started writing geoprocessing scripts.

A few points to remember about Python:

* Python code can be evaluated directly in the interactive Python inter preter, but to save your code you have to create a Python script file, which is saved with a .py file extension.

* Python uses expressions, which represent a value or values, and statements, which do something.

* Variable names should be all lowercase and contain only characters, digits, and the underscore (_). Variables are given a value using an assígnment statement.

* Python contains a number of standard built-in functions , which can be used by employing a function call. To use a function that is not one of the built-in functions, you fust need to import the module, and then call the function using <module>.<function>.

* Strings can be manipulated using Python's built-in methods, includ ing fmding speci&c substrings, joining strings together, splitting strings based on a separator, stripping characters from the start and end of a string, converting the case of a string, and more.

* Lists are a versatile Python data type. Speci&c elements from a list can be obtained using the element's index number starting with zero (0)-for example, mylist[0]. There are a number of built-in Python functions and methods to manipulate lists. These include ways to sort a list, slice a list into smaller lists, delete elements, append elements, insert elements, and more.

* Workflow in Python scripts can be controlled using branching and loop structures. These structures use indentation to identify blocks of code. lndentation is part of the Python syntax and is not optional.

* Python syntax is case sensitive, for the most part.
